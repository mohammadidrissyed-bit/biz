Your task is to generate a model **chapter-wise question paper** based on Previous Year Questions (PYQs) that strictly adheres to the official DPUE format.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Subject & Context:** The paper is for **${subject}**, **${classLevel}**, focusing specifically on the chapter: **"${chapter?.title}"**.
2.  **Strict Format Adherence:** Replicate the **exact official format, structure, and style** used by the Karnataka DPUE Board. This is the most important instruction. Use official phrasing, typography (bold headers), numbering, and marks in brackets.
3.  **Content:** All questions must be relevant to the specified chapter and reflect the style of actual board exam questions.
4.  **No Answers:** Generate **only the question paper**. Do NOT include any answers, explanations, or model solutions.
5.  **Marks & Timing:** The total marks for this chapter-wise paper should be approximately 25-30 marks, with a suggested time of 1 Hour.
6.  **Official Header:** Use the exact header format, including the specific spacing:
    **DEPARTMENT OF PRE–UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, KARNATAKA**
    **Subject:** ${subject}
    **Class:** ${classLevel}
    **Chapter:** ${chapter?.title}
    **Time:** 1 Hour  **Maximum Marks:** 30
7.  **Official Structure:** Follow the DPUE pattern precisely. Adapt the sections and number of questions to fit the ~30 mark limit. Here is the structure for a full paper for reference:

    **PART – A**
    **I. Answer the following questions in one word or one sentence each: (10 × 1 = 10 Marks)**
    1. ...
    ...

    **PART – B**
    **II. Answer any FIVE of the following questions in two or three sentences each: (5 × 2 = 10 Marks)**
    11. ...
    ...

    **PART – C**
    **III. Answer any THREE of the following questions in 15 to 20 sentences each: (3 × 4 = 12 Marks)**
    21. ...
    ...

    **PART – D**
    **IV. Answer any TWO of the following questions in about two pages each: (2 × 8 = 16 Marks)**
    31. ...
    ...

    **PART – E (Practical Oriented Questions)**
    **V. Answer any ONE of the following questions: (1 × 5 = 5 Marks)**
    41. ...

8.  **Adaptation for Chapter Test:** Since this is a chapter-wise test for ~30 marks, you must select and adapt the sections appropriately. For example, you might include questions from Part A, B, and C, and maybe one from D or E, ensuring the total marks are around 30. The number of questions and choices ('Answer any X') should be adjusted accordingly.

The final output must be pure markdown, ready for rendering, and look identical in style to an official DPUE paper.`;

        - \`solution\`: A string containing the step-by-step solution. This can use markdown for formatting if needed.
        - \`answer\`: A string containing the final answer, clearly stated.
3.  **Accuracy:** Ensure all formulas, variable descriptions, and solved examples are accurate and relevant to the DPUE syllabus.
